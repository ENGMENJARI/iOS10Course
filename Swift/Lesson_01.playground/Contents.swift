// in swift play gound there's no need to print method

var decimal = 5.4

decimal = 4



// this will give us an error because decimal is a Double type not String
// decimal = "MajdEddin"





let tax = 0.16

// this will give us an error becaause let is a constant -> this mean it can't be changed
// tax = 55.3
// mutable : means changable (var instead of let)



// Rules of defining variables:
// 1. not start with a number
// 2. not contains a space
// 3. not duplicated 
// 4. not a keyword




// var name accepts unicode
var üçï = "pizza"



var x1 = 4, x2 = 3, x3 = 5

// swift is smart you don't need to specifiy the data type


// this called type annotation which mean you specify the type of the variable
var msg:String = "hello"
